 The idea is to build a CRM from scratch to learn all the principles and best practices to develop a real apps. The objective of this CRM is to make people sign petitions and then having a user database that we could use to maintain a relationship with our people.




This is my first draft for a Roadmap for the project:

+create models for users and petitions
+create basic layout
+create basic views
+create authentication system using a gem (devise)
-enforce the relationship between the models 
-create roles => a user can be leader,follower
-create a compaign model => a compaign contains multiple petitions
-add Facebook authentication support
-add Twitter authentication support
-create an administration panel for leaders
-create a emailing system to keep you users informed
-Think about a ranking system to distinguish the activity between users
-create charts to see how petitions are progressing
-Feel free to make any suggestion!!
